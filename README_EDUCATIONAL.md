### 🚫 **DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE:**
- ❌ **In any online Counter-Strike 2 matches**
- ❌ **On any VAC-secured servers**
- ❌ **For competitive advantage**
- ❌ **To violate game terms of service**
- ❌ **In any way that could result in account bans**

### ⚖️ **Legal and Ethical Considerations:**
- This software may violate Valve's Terms of Service
- Using this in CS2 can result in **PERMANENT VAC BANS**
- Account bans may affect your Steam inventory and other games
- We take **NO RESPONSIBILITY** for any consequences of use
- This is provided for educational analysis only

## 🧪 Safe Testing Environment

**If you must test this software for educational purposes:**

1. **Use Offline Only**:
   - Local server with bots only
   - `-insecure` launch parameter
   - No internet connection

2. **Separate Steam Account**:
   - Use a throwaway account
   - Do not link to main account
   - Accept risk of permanent ban

3. **Virtual Machine**:
   - Run in isolated environment
   - Easy to reset if needed
   - Prevents system-wide issues
